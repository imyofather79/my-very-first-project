Story:

This is just a quick fun webpage interactive game that the end-user will work as a bartender and making cocktails for the customers.


MVP:
1.The user will be able to select drink from the search ID textbox. The user selected drink by utilizing the assigned ID number of the cocktail and "Submit" button. The name of the drink should be rendered on the page along with its listed ingredients. 
2.After the user has populated the drink on the webpage, the ingredients of the drink can be removed by selecting the "Mix/Shake" button to mimic the procedure of making a cocktail.
3.The end of the "Serve", a image of the drink should be rendered on the page for certain amount of seconds and then the page to loop back to its initial state.


Stretch Goals
1.Randomize the drink option
2.Adding styles with the wordings
3.Adding image of the drink, if possible
4.Adding the random tips feature
5.Enable the up-down motion of the shaker
