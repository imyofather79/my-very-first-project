Story:

This is just a quick fun webpage interactive game that the end-user will work as a bartender and making cocktails for the customers.


MVP:
1.The user will be able to be able to generate a set of cocktail info onto the webpage by utilizing the "Random" button. The name of the drink should be rendered on the page along with its listed ingredients. 
2.After the user has populated the drink on the webpage, the generated data of the drink should be removed by selecting the "Mix&Shake" button to mimic the procedure of making a cocktail.
3.The end of the "Serve", a image of the drink should be rendered on the page for certain amount of seconds and then the page to loop back to its initial state.
4.A reset button will be available for the user to reset and restart the interactive webpage without actually refreshing the browser.
